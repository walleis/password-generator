Password Generator
Welcome to the Password Generator, a simple Python program that creates randomized passwords based on user input! This tool allows you to specify how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password, then generates a secure, shuffled result.

How It Works
The program prompts the user to input the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.
It randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and symbols (!, #, $, etc.).
The selected characters are combined into a list, shuffled for randomness, and then joined into a single string.
The final password is displayed to the user.

Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system. The program uses the built-in random module, so no additional libraries are needed.

Installation
Download or clone this repository to your computer.
Verify that Python is installed by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal.
Run the program by opening a terminal in the project folder and typing:
python password_generator.py
